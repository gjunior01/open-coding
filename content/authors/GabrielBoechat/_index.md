At the moment I'm in progress to achieve my Bachelor Degree in [Economics](http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/). While working with a economics research team, I usually create (and share) codes to better visualize theoretical concepts around quantitative finance and several topics in economics. If you'd like to know part of my work, you can check my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gab_boechat) account.
